# Side Project Tracker ⚒️

> Less hassle, more hustle

**Available Domain:** Sidebuilds.com

##  TLDR

A lightweight platform where builders can track, organize, and share their side projects, with the option of selling them in the future.

## 1. Problem/Opportunity 

Entrepreneurs often juggle multiple side projects, leading to difficulty in tracking progress and many unfinished ideas. These projects represent untapped potential. Similar to how platforms like Etsy unlocked value in crafts or Airbnb in unused rooms, there's a need for a platform dedicated to organizing and potentially monetizing side projects.

**Market Size:** Estimated 5–10 million active side project builders worldwide who could benefit from this tooling.

## 2. Solution 

**The Idea:** A lightweight platform where builders can track, organize, and share their side projects, with the option of selling them in the future.

**How it Works:**

*   **User Dashboard:** Users sign up and get a dashboard to track their side projects.
*   **Project Tracking:** Projects can be tracked by various metrics like idea stage, MVP build status, domain ownership, revenue, user growth, etc.
*   **Privacy & Sharing:** Projects can be kept private or shared publicly with the community.
*   **Collaboration (Optional):** Shared projects could allow for community collaboration.
*   **Marketplace:** With a single click, users can list a project for sale on an integrated marketplace where buyers can browse and purchase.

## 3. Go-to-Market Strategy 

*   Launch via Product Hunt, Indie Hackers, and Twitter/X.
*   Target the "build-in-public" community.

## 4. Business Model

*   **Freemium:** Free tier to track up to 2 projects.
*   **Paid Plans:** $8–$20/month for unlimited projects and the ability to list projects for sale.
*   **Marketplace Commission:** Take a commission on each successful project sale through the platform.

## 5. Startup Costs 

Initial development for core features could be relatively low cost. Scaling, especially the marketplace component, might require future investment or fundraising.

## 6. Technology Stack 

*   **Frontend:** React
*   **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL

## 7. Development Roadmap 

**Phase 1: Planning and Setup**

*   [ ] **Detailed Project Plan & Roadmap:** Refine this roadmap with specific features for each phase.
*   [x] **Technology Stack Selection:** Decide on the specific technologies.
*   [x] **Initial Project Structure:** Set up the basic directory structure.
*   [x] **Detailed README.md:** Create this comprehensive README file.

**Phase 2: Core Tracking Features (MVP)**

*   [x] **Database Schema Design:** Design tables/collections for users and projects. *(SQL script provided, requires manual execution)*
*   [x] **User Authentication:** Implement signup, login, session management. *(Backend API + Frontend Auth Flow complete)*
*   [x] **Project CRUD:** Implement Create, Read, Update, Delete for projects. *(Backend API + Frontend UI complete)*
*   [x] **Dashboard View:** Create the main user dashboard to display projects. *(Backend endpoint + Frontend UI complete)*

**Phase 3: Enhancements and Sharing**

*   [x] **Project Detail View:** Create a view for individual project details. *(Implemented as part of Project CRUD)*
*   [x] **Sharing Functionality:** Implement public/private toggles for projects. *(Backend + Frontend public list complete)*
*   [ ] **Community/Collaboration Features (Optional/Later Phase):** Browse shared projects, potential collaboration tools.

**Phase 4: Marketplace Integration**

*   [x] **Seller Functionality:** Allow users to mark projects for sale (add pricing, description). *(Implemented via project form/edit)*
*   [x] **Buyer Marketplace View:** Create a browseable marketplace page. *(Backend + Frontend UI complete)*
*   [x] **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate Stripe/PayPal for transactions. *(Basic Stripe structure (checkout session, webhook handler, frontend redirect) implemented. Requires API keys, webhook setup, and fulfillment logic)*
*   [x] **Commission Logic:** Implement commission calculation on sales. *(Placeholder added in webhook handler. Requires specific business logic and potentially payout implementation)*

**Phase 5: Deployment and Scaling**

*   [x] **Deployment Strategy:** Plan and execute deployment (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Vercel). *(Discussed options like Vercel+Render/Heroku. Requires manual setup)*
*   [x] **Scalability:** Design for growth. *(Basic considerations discussed - DB indexing, stateless API, PaaS scaling)*
*   [x] **Monitoring & Maintenance:** Set up monitoring and plan for upkeep. *(Basic logging is present. Discussed monitoring tools like UptimeRobot/Sentry and dependency updates)*
