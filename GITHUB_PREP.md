# GitHub Upload Preparation Guide

This guide will help you prepare your SideProject Tracker for uploading to GitHub.

## Before Pushing to GitHub

1. **Ensure no sensitive information is committed:**
   - Check that no API keys or secrets are hardcoded in any files
   - Confirm all `.env` files are ignored by git
   - Double-check `/server/routes/payments.js` for any hardcoded Stripe keys

2. **Remove large binary files:**
   - Make sure `cockroach.zip` is not included in the repository
   - Delete or ignore any other large binary files

3. **Clean up node_modules:**
   - Ensure all `node_modules` directories are properly ignored
   - Run `git clean -fdx` if needed to remove any untracked files

4. **Clean up temporary files:**
   - Delete any temporary test or debugging files
   - Remove any logs or error reports

5. **Final check with git status:**
   ```
   git status
   ```
   This should only show the essential project files.

## Creating a GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name your repository (e.g., "sideproject-tracker")
   - Choose public or private visibility
   - Do not initialize with README, license, or .gitignore (you already have these)

2. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/sideproject-tracker.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## After Pushing to GitHub

1. **Set up branch protection rules:**
   - Go to repository Settings > Branches
   - Add a branch protection rule for `main`
   - Require pull request reviews before merging

2. **Add collaborators if needed:**
   - Go to repository Settings > Collaborators
   - Add any team members who need access

3. **Set up GitHub Actions (optional):**
   - Create a `.github/workflows` directory
   - Add CI/CD workflow files for automated testing and deployment

## Sensitive Environment Variables

For any sensitive environment variables (like API keys), consider using GitHub Secrets if you set up GitHub Actions, or use a secure environment variable management solution for your deployment platform.

## Deployment Platforms

Remember to set up your environment variables on your deployment platforms:
- For the backend: Set all server-side variables on Render or your chosen platform
- For the frontend: Set client-side variables on Vercel or your chosen platform

Good luck with your project!
